      <h2>Tina Turner as a rock star</h2>
      <p>Born Anna Mae Bullock in November 26th 1939 in Nutbush, Tennessee. She began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, first recording under the name "Little Ann". She was introduced to the public as Tina Turner in 1960 as a member of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. Success followed with a string of hits credited to the duo, including "A Fool in Love" (1960), "River Deep – Mountain High" (1966), "Proud Mary" (1971), and "Nutbush City Limits" (1973), a song that she wrote. Tina writes about the start of her singing career as well as her marriage with Ike Turner in her autobiography &#40;co-written by MTV news correspondent and music critic Kurt Loder&#41; "I, Tina" released in 1986. The book became a best-seller and led to the film adaptation, "What's Love Got to Do with It", in 1993 starring Angela Bassett as Turner.</p>
